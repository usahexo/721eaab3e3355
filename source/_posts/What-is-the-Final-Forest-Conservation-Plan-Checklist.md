#  What is the Final Forest Conservation Plan Checklist?

Looking for a comprehensive guide to help you through the final stages of forest conservation planning? You've come to the right place! The Forest Conservation Plan Checklist can help you ensure your project is on track and compliant with all relevant regulations.

The first step in developing your conservation plan is to gather information about the site and surrounding area. This includes studying aerial photos, topography maps, and other data sources to identify features of interest. Once you have identified the areas of greatest concern, you can begin to draft your management goals and objectives.

Your conservation plan should be tailored to meet the specific needs of your site, so make sure to consult with local experts as needed. The following checklist will help you make sure that all aspects of your plan are considered:

1. Site characterization – What kind of vegetation is found on the site? What wildlife is present? What are the prevailing soil and climate conditions?
2. Land use history – What has been done to the land in the past (e.g., logging, mining, development)? What are current and potential land uses in the area?
3. Threats and Opportunities Assessment – What are the major threats facing the site (e.g., fire, pests and diseases, development pressure)? What opportunities exist for improving or protecting the forest (e.g., education and outreach, restoration)?
4. Management Goals and Objectives – what do you want to achieve with your forest conservation plan? Are there specific species or habitats you want to protect? 
5. Strategies and Actions – How will you achieve your management goals and objectives? What actions will be taken (e.g., land acquisition, restoration, monitoring)?
6. Monitoring Plan – How will you know if your management strategies are working? What types of data will be collected and how often will it be monitored?
7. Staffing and Funding Requirements –Who will be responsible for implementing the plan? How much money will be needed to carry out the plan?
8. Contingency Plans –What if something goes wrong? What if one of your strategies fails? Have alternate plans ready in case of unexpected events.

#  Who created the Final Forest Conservation Plan Checklist?

The Final Forest Conservation Plan Checklist was created in collaboration between the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change, Ontario and the Greenbelt Foundation.

#  What does the Final Forest Conservation Plan Checklist cover? 
The Forest Conservation Plan (FCP) is created to identify and protect wetlands and streams, and to ensure that forest fragmentation is minimized. The final FCP checklist covers:
- Aerial photo of the project site 
- Boundaries of proposed project site 
- Location of all wetlands within the project site 
- Location of all perennial and intermittent streams within the project site 
- Identification of any Federally listed threatened or endangered species that may occur on the project site 
- Description of any habitats that will be impacted by the proposed activity, including whether they are considered high value habitats 
- Mitigation measures to be implemented in order to offset any impacts to wetlands, streams, or habitats

#  When is the Final Forest Conservation Plan Checklist due?

The final Forest Conservation Plan Checklist is due on or before December 1, 2019.

#  How can the Final Forest Conservation Plan Checklist be accessed?

The Final Forest Conservation Plan Checklist is available through the [Minnesota Department of Natural Resources](https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/) website. It can be accessed through the DNR's homepage, or by clicking on the 'Environment' tab and then selecting 'Final Forest Conservation Plan Checklist' from the drop-down menu.

The checklist covers a wide range of topics related to forest conservation, including woodland management, landscape diversity, stream corridor protection, and invasive species control. It also includes a summary of public comments received during the development of the final plan, as well as a detailed description of how each topic was addressed.
