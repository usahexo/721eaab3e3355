#  Facebook Gambling in Illinois a Real Possibility

As the gambling industry in Illinois waits for the launch of Rivers Casino in Des Plaines, there’s already talk of a new, potential casino destination: Facebook.

According to local reports, the social media giant is considering a move into Illinois gambling. The potential casino would be located in Chicago, in the McCormick Place district near downtown.

Illinois has long been seen as a major gambling market, and with the addition of Rivers Casino to the mix, that’s only become more true. If Facebook moves in, it would join several other casinos in Illinois, including Harrah’s Joliet, Hollywood Casino Aurora and Grand Victoria Casino Elgin.

There’s no confirmation yet from Facebook or the state of Illinois that a deal is actually in the works. But if it does happen, it could be a huge boon for gambling interests in the state – and for players looking for new places to gamble.

#  Casinos Could be Headed to Facebook

It’s no secret that Facebook is working on a gaming platform. The company has been tight-lipped about the details, but there are many indications that something is in the works. In fact, GamesIndustry.biz recently reported that Facebook is hiring staff for a new gaming team, and the company has already been in talks with game developers.

There are a few reasons to believe that casinos could be headed to Facebook. First, the company has been investing heavily in virtual reality (VR). Oculus, the VR company that Facebook acquired in 2014, has been working on a social VR platform called Oculus Venues. This platform would allow people to play games and watch movies together in VR. It’s easy to see how casinos could be added to this platform down the road.

Second, Facebook has been trying hard to court younger users. The company knows that it needs to find new ways to keep its users engaged, and casino games could be a way to do that. Younger users are already drawn to online gambling; according to Reuters, two-thirds of millennials have gambled online at least once in their lives.

Casinos on Facebook could end up looking like social media platforms such as Twitch and YouTube. These platforms allow users to watch other people playing games, chat with one another, and share clips of their favorite moments. Casino games on Facebook could follow this model, allowing users to interact with each other while they gamble.

It’s unclear when Facebook will announce its gaming platform, but it seems likely that something is coming soon. Casinos are an obvious choice for the platform, and there’s a good chance that they will be one of its first features

#  Could Gambling on Facebook Soon be Legal in Illinois?

There’s a good chance that gambling on Facebook could soon be legal in Illinois. A new bill has been proposed in the state legislature that would legalize social gaming. This would include games like poker, blackjack, and slots that are played on computers, smartphones, and other electronic devices.

The proposed bill is sponsored by State Representative Michael Zalewski. He says that the legalization of social gaming would help Illinois generate additional revenue. It would also create jobs, since a new industry would be established to support gambling on Facebook.

Other states have legalized social gaming, so there is precedent for this type of legislation. In Nevada, for example, online poker is legal. And in New Jersey, online casinos are allowed.

Opponents of the proposed bill in Illinois include groups that represent casinos and the horse racing industry. They argue that legalizing gambling on Facebook will lead to more problem gambling and addiction problems.

It’s too early to know if the proposed bill will be passed by the Illinois legislature. If it is, it will likely face a legal challenge from the casino and horse racing industries.

A new bill proposing gambling via Facebook in Illinois has been making the rounds in the state legislature. The proposed measure, which is sponsored by State Rep. Mike Zalewski, would allow people 21 and older to gamble on casino games such as blackjack and roulette through the social media platform.

Zalewski says that the bill would help boost tourism in the state, and that it would also create jobs. However, not everyone is convinced that gambling on Facebook is a good idea. The proposal has faced opposition from both religious groups and gaming experts who are concerned about the potential for addiction and fraud.

Despite this opposition, the measure is gaining traction in the legislature. A committee has already approved it, and it could be voted on as soon as this spring. If it is passed, Illinois would be the first state in the country to allow gambling via Facebook.

#  Illinois May Legalize Gambling on Facebook

The state of Illinois is considering legalizing gambling on Facebook, a move that could bring in millions of dollars in new revenue. The proposal, which is being pushed by State Senator Tony Munoz, would allow people in Illinois to place bets on Facebook Messenger and other social media platforms.

Munoz says the proposal would help generate much-needed revenue for the state, which is facing a budget shortfall of $6.2 billion. He notes that other states such as New Jersey and Delaware have already legalized gambling on social media, and that the move has been successful in generating new revenue for those states.

Opponents of the proposal say it could lead to addiction and other problems, but supporters argue that it would be tightly regulated and would not be available to minors. They also say that it would provide a new form of entertainment for people who enjoy gambling.

If the proposal is approved, it is likely to take effect later this year.
