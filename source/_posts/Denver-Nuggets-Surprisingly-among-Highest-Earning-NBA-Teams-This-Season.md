#  Denver Nuggets Surprisingly among Highest-Earning NBA Teams This Season

Forbes recently released its annual list of the NBA’s highest-earning teams, and the Denver Nuggets made an unexpected appearance in third place.

Coming into the season, most people would have guessed that teams like the Golden State Warriors or Los Angeles Lakers would be at the top of the list. But with a salary cap of over $101 million, the Nuggets still managed to bring in a whopping $246 million in revenue.

Much of this comes from TV deals, sponsorship agreements, and ticket sales. And while player salaries account for a good chunk of team expenses, the Nuggets are fortunate enough to have some big names on their roster who don’t take up too much of the cap.

Some of their top earners include Nikola Jokić, Jamal Murray, Paul Millsap, and Gary Harris. Jokić in particular is one of the most underpaid players in the NBA, making just $1.5 million this season. But with his rising popularity and talent on the court, that number is sure to increase significantly in future years.

The Nuggets are currently sitting in second place in the Western Conference, so it looks like their high earnings are well deserved!

#  Denver Nuggets Look Primed for a Deep Playoff Run

Led by Nikola Jokic, the Denver Nuggets have looked like one of the best teams in the NBA during the first half of the season. They currently sit in third place in the West with a record of 34-17.

Jokic has been dominant, averaging 20.3 points, 10.8 rebounds, and 7.5 assists per game. He has also developed into one of the best defenders in the league, averaging 1.8 blocks and 1.5 steals per game.

Other players like Jamal Murray and Gary Harris have also stepped up this season. Murray is averaging 19.4 points per game while Harris is averaging 17.7 points per game.

The Nuggets have a deep roster that can compete with any team in the NBA. They will be a tough opponent for anyone in the playoffs this year.

#  How Denver Nuggets' Nikola Jokic Became one of the League's Most Valuable Players

When the Denver Nuggets drafted Nikola Jokic with the 41st pick in the 2014 NBA draft, they could not have imagined he would become one of the league's most valuable players. But that is exactly what has happened.

Jokic's unique skill set and passion for the game have allowed him to develop into one of the best players in the NBA. His abilities to shoot from outside, pass and rebound make him a matchup nightmare for opposing teams.

This season, Jokic is averaging 20.3 points, 10.8 rebounds and 7.6 assists per game. He is also shooting 47 percent from the field and 38 percent from three-point range. These numbers are all career highs for Jokic.

He has been especially good in the playoffs, averaging 24 points, 12 rebounds and 8 assists per game while shooting 49 percent from the field and 43 percent from three-point range.

Jokic's play has led the Nuggets to the second round of the playoffs where they currently sit tied 2-2 with the Portland Trail Blazers. With Jokic leading the way, there is no telling what heights this Nuggets team can reach.

#  What Makes Denver Nuggets So Hard to Defend in Today's NBA?

Denver Nuggets is one of the NBA teams that have been playing very well this season. They are currently in the third place in the Western Conference with a record of 36 wins and 18 losses. What makes them so hard to defend in today's NBA?

The first thing that comes to mind is their offense. They are averaging 114.8 points per game which is good for fourth in the league. They have a lot of weapons on offense, which makes it hard for defenders to know who to focus on. Their starters all average at least 10 points per game, and they also have a lot of depth off the bench.

Another reason why Denver Nuggets is hard to defend is because they play fast. They are averaging 102.6 possessions per game which is good for fifth in the league. This helps them get easy baskets, as well as put pressure on the defense.

Finally, their defense has been much better this season than in previous years. They are allowing only 103.2 points per game, which is fifth best in the league. This has been a big reason why they have been winning more games this season.

#  How the Denver Nuggets Use Their Depth to Overcome Adversity

The Denver Nuggets have been one of the NBA’s biggest surprises this season. After making a blockbuster trade with the Oklahoma City Thunder that sent Carmelo Anthony to New York, many people believed that the Nuggets would be one of the worst teams in the league. However, the Nuggets currently sit in third place in the Western Conference with a record of 34-17.

One of the main reasons for the Nuggets’ success has been their depth. Led by All-Star forward Paul Millsap, the Nuggets have nine players who average at least 8 points per game. This depth has allowed them to overcome injuries to key players such as Nikola Jokic and Gary Harris.

Jokic, who is averaging 16.7 points and 10.5 rebounds per game, missed eleven games in January and February with a sprained ankle. In those games, the Nuggets went 7-4 with all four losses coming against teams that currently have a better record than them. Harris, who is averaging 17.7 points per game, has missed eight games this season with various injuries. The Nuggets are 5-3 in those games.

This depth has also allowed the Nuggets to stay competitive when Millsap is struggling offensively. Millsap is averaging 17.8 points per game this season, but he has only scored over 20 points twice in his last twelve games. However, the Nuggets have still been able to win six of those twelve games thanks to their balanced scoring attack.

The depth of the Nuggets has also given coach Michael Malone some interesting lineup options late in games. For example, Malone has recently been using Kenneth Faried and Mason Plumlee together in crunch time instead of Jokic and Millsap. This gives Malone two strong rebounders and rim protectors who can also score around the basket.

The combination of depth and versatility has made the Nuggets one of the most dangerous teams in the NBA this season. If they continue to play at this level, they could make a deep run in the playoffs.
