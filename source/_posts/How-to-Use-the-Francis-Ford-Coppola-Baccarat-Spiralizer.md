#  How to Use the Francis Ford Coppola Baccarat Spiralizer

In this article, we will show you how to use the Francis Ford Coppola Baccarat Spiralizer.

First, gather all of the necessary ingredients and supplies. You will need:

-One spiralizer
-One cutting board
-A vegetable peeler
-One large saucepan
-Water
-Salt
-Two tablespoons of olive oil
-Two cloves of garlic, minced
-One pound of butternut squash, peeled and seeded
-One tablespoon of brown sugar
-One teaspoon of dried thyme leaves
-Half a cup of grated Parmesan cheese
Now that you have all of the ingredients and supplies, you can start preparing the dish. First, set the large saucepan on the stove and fill it with water. Add salt to the water and set it on high heat so that it begins to boil. While the water is heating up, prepare the vegetables. Use the vegetable peeler to peel the skin off of the butternut squash. Then, use a small knife to cut the squash in half lengthwise. Remove the seeds from inside of the squash using a spoon. Finally, cut the squash into thin strips using the spiralizer. 
Do the same thing with the garlic cloves by peeling off their skin and then mincing them using a sharp knife. Then, set a tablespoon of olive oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Once hot, add in the garlic and swirl it around until it becomes fragrant (about 30 seconds).Add in all of the prepared vegetables and give them a good stir. Be sure to coat everything in olive oil. Then, add in the brown sugar and thyme leaves and stir again until everything is evenly coated. Covering your pan with a lid will help steam and soften your vegetables quicker—only do this if your pan has a lid! Let everything cook for about five minutes before adding in half a cup of grated Parmesan cheese. Stir until everything is melted in and serve garnished with parsley if desired!Enjoy your delicious Francis Ford Coppola Baccarat Spiralizer dish!
