#  Suns new head coach impresses at beating Vegas in sports betting 

The Suns have a new head coach and he has already impressed many in the sports betting world by beating Vegas. In his first game as head coach, he led the Suns to an upset victory over the heavily favored Golden State Warriors.

The Suns were 8.5 point underdogs in this game, but they managed to pull off the upset victory by a score of 119-110. This was a major win for Phoenix and it showed that they have plenty of talent on their roster.

The biggest reason for this victory was the play of Devin Booker. He led all scorers with 38 points and he also had 11 assists. Booker is one of the most talented young players in the NBA and he looks like he is ready to take over as the leader of this team.

Josh Jackson also played well for the Suns, scoring 20 points on 9-of-14 shooting from the field. He also grabbed nine rebounds to help his team get the win.

Andre Iguodala was the top scorer for the Warriors with 24 points, but no other player on Golden State was able to score more than 16 points. Stephen Curry shot just 5-of-17 from the field and Kevin Durant was held to 18 points on 7-of-19 shooting.

This was a disappointing loss for Golden State and it will likely cause them to fall in the power rankings heading into next week’s games. It will be interesting to see if they can rebound from this loss and make a run at winning another championship this season.

#  Suns find new way to beat Vegas in sports betting 

In the last few years, the Phoenix Suns have had their ups and downs. They were able to win a few games, but they couldn't seem to get past the first round of the playoffs. 

However, in the 2017-2018 season, they managed to win 48 games and make it to the second round of the playoffs. This was a big improvement from previous years. 

One of the reasons for their success was their ability to beat Vegas in sports betting. In some cases, they were even able to cover the spread by more than 10 points. This was a big change from in previous years when they usually lost money by betting on themselves. 

There are several reasons for this change. First, the team has been playing better as a whole. Second, Coach Igor Kokoskov has done a good job of coaching the team and making adjustments during games. Finally, Devin Booker has emerged as one of the best players in the league, and he has been able to take over games when necessary. 

Overall, the Suns are looking like a much better team this year than they have in previous years. If they can continue to play well and beat Vegas in sports betting, they should be able to make it deep into the playoffs

#  Suns continue to surprise Vegas in sports betting 

The Phoenix Suns continue to surpass expectations in the NBA, and that has been reflected in their odds to win the championship. 

The Suns were originally given 100-1 odds to win the title at the beginning of the season, but those odds have shortened to 50-1 as the team has exceeded even the most optimistic preseason projections. 

Phoenix’s hot start can be attributed to a number of factors, including breakout performances from Devin Booker and Deandre Ayton, as well as strong play from veterans such as TJ Warren and Jamal Crawford. 

The Suns will face a tough test on Wednesday night when they travel to Oakland to take on the Golden State Warriors, who are still considered by many to be the favorites to win it all this year. 

However, if they can continue playing at this level, there’s no reason why Phoenix can’t make some noise in the Western Conference playoffs.

#  Suns upset Vegas in sports betting once again 

In a stunning move that has upset the sports betting world, the Phoenix Suns have come out on top against the heavily favored Vegas Golden Knights.

The Suns were listed as a 14-point underdog heading into Wednesday night's matchup, but they managed to pull off the upset victory with a final score of 116-104.

This is just the latest in a long line of upsets for the Suns when it comes to sports betting, as they have now beaten the odds in six of their last seven games.

Some experts are calling it a "sucker's bet" to put money on the Suns, but those who have followed this team closely all season know that they are capable of beating anyone when they're playing at their best.

Many people are still skeptical about this team, but there's no doubt that they have proven themselves time and time again this year.

If you're looking for a potential dark horse candidate in the NBA playoffs, don't overlook the Phoenix Suns.

#  Suns prove that they can beat Vegas in sports betting

The Phoenix Suns were longshots to beat the Vegas Golden Knights in the first round of the NHL playoffs. Vegas was a -210 favorite, meaning you would have to bet $210 to win $100.

Phoenix defied the odds, however, and won the series 4-1. In fact, they were actually one of the best NBA betting picks in the first round overall.

So how did they do it?

 Some experts attributed Phoenix’s success to their veteran players and their experience playing together. That certainly helped, but it wasn’t the only factor.

The Suns also had a strong defensive game plan that threw Vegas off balance. They consistently pressured the Golden Knights’ puck handlers and disrupted their offensive flow.

Phoenix also got solid goaltending from their two netminders, Darcy Kuemper and Mike Smith. Kuemper especially was impressive, making some crucial saves late in games to preserve leads for the Suns.

Overall, it was a great team effort by Phoenix, and they should be proud of their accomplishment. They have definitely proved that they can beat the odds when it comes to sports betting.
